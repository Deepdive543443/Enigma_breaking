\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Machine learning (Deep learning) is a trending topic in computer science fields, especially in Computer vision and Natural language processing area. When it comes to Cybersecurity, Machine Learning's application were mostly focus on defensive purpose, includes malicious code pattern detection, network traffic detection, etc. For some reason, the application of machine learning on cryptanalysis is still rare and limited. Quantum computing could make a huge impact on cryptographic because of its potential ability on brute-forcing ciphers exponentially faster than modern computers. We assume modern machine learning technique also has potential to perform similar impact by "understanding" the ciphers because of its strong abilities in natural language and images understanding. With this question in mind, we followed some of the research on machine learning application on cryptgraphic and made our own experiment on exploring the machine learning ability on cryptanalysis. By this project, we hope our works could clear out the fog on Machine learning based cryptanalysis and its potential influence in the future.
